            <p> During the early 80's major cities like Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, Calgary and Vancouver played roles in the popularity of Vespas courtesy of The Who's film Quadrophenia. </p>
            <p>There were different groups that rode Vespas from Mods, skinheads, uni and of course scooter boys (Canada's version). There were many rallies in Southern Ontario, specifically Niagara Falls, and all parts in between as well as Mod nights in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.</p>
            <p>It's the enthusiasm of Vespa lovers/owners that make this community thrive. Whether it's a slick paint scheme, modded out scoots, go-fast scoots or bog standard it's the rider that makes it their own.</p>
            <p>Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Halifax have clubs that continue to hold rallies as well as Vancouver, with their mild winters allowing year-round scootering. 
            As the scooter culture grew across the nation, local clubs quickly formed to better meet the needs of their local scootering community.</p>
